TODO:

	Pizza:
		sometimes pieces of road are missing, always on slopes. But the piece before the slope is also missing?! First debug by displaying tile data on mouse over.
			Is if slope is 3 and roadDir is 4 or 3.
			On Connecting road the problem is that the road wants to connect from one slope to the neighbour slope tile. Not moving down to the lower tile but left or right. Must make sure in Pathfinding that this is not a valid connection.

		Map not rendered when one dimension is 512 and the other is much smaller 128 or smth.

	Generator:

		City Gen: Make sure not to walk sideways on a slope. Same for road connecting see above.

		Remove buildings not next to a road?

		Place trees on slopes!

		Check if creating road connections makes sure that start and end point are roads!

		Check if neighbour tile already is part of other city, than stop going there.

	UI:
		Scrollbar: not working properly.
		Scrollbar: scrolls further down then the last element, there is a gap between last element and the edge.
		(done) Sliders: Make bar clickable.
		(fixed) horizontal layout is weird with the y-positining of its childs.
		(fixed) Checkbox Wrap Content does not work right.

		Add:
			Text Input
			Number changer?
